### Description:

**This project uses web sockets to establish a live connection between a client and the 
server, allowing the client to chat in real time with other users. Along with the ability 
to create chat-rooms, a user has access to server commands within the chat-room for various 
real-world uses.**

# Improvements

### Chat-Room Commands:
**Users in a chat-room have the ability to use chat commands, which are indicated by a forward slash '/' at the 
beginning of a message followed by the specified command. Commands can be seen on the right side of the chat-room 
web page. Steps have been taken to ensure improperly formatted commands are ignored.**

- `/users`
**This command returns all users currently in a chat-room. If a user in the chat-room has 
not entered a name for themselves (ie: user has not sent a message yet) they will be 
included in the count of "Anonymous" users.**
  - Example usage of */users* command:
    > */users*


- `/whisper`
**This command only sends a message to the user specified in the command. If a user whispers to a username
which does not exist in the chat-room, the user whispering will be notified that the user being whispered
to does not exist.**
  - Example usage of */whisper* command:
    > */whisper user1 hello how are you*
    
    In this case *"user1"* will receive the message *"hello how are you"*.


- `/rand`
  **This command returns to all users a random number between two numbers provided in the message.**
  - Examples usage of */rand* command:
    > */rand 1 10*

    > */rand 50 20*
    
    In these cases ***all*** users in the chatroom will receive a message containing the random number generated between 
    the provided numbers.

### Refresh Chat-Room List Button:
**A small improvement made to the web applications UI is the addition of a "â†»" button which refreshes the
list of chat-rooms.**

### Send Chat Button:
**A small improvement made to the web applications UI is the addition of a "Send" button which sends a users
message.**
